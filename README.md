# Payment Application

#### for EgFWD Embedded Systems Professional Nanodegree Program

Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.
There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.

SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account.
REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account.
Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation.
VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.
I implement the SALE transaction only by simulating the card, terminal(ATM), and the server.
